Does your project style not adhere seamlessly to rules from a style guide? In this concise course—the second installment in the ESLint series—learn how to add and override rules to your ESLint configuration to ensure that you won't get flagged for "errors" that are really just aspects of your personal style. Instructor Sasha Vodnik shows how to customize your configuration by adding style rules to the predefined rules, as well as how to specify detailed configuration options for certain rules. Plus, learn how to identify and fix common configuration issues in ESLint.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Folders
The files are divided into three folders, which represent 3 separate projects:
  - The `customizing` folder contains the project used in videos `01_01` and `01_02`.
  - The `troubleshooting` folder contains the project used in video `01_03`.
  - The `challenge` folder contains the project used in videos `01_04` and `01_05`.
